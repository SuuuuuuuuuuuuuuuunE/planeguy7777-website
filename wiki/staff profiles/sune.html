        <h3>
            About Me
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Hey there! I am <b>SuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunE</b>, or simply SunE, one of the first staff members here at POS. You may know me as a host from countless events or a moderator for both iterations of the POMS (Planeguy7777 Official Minecraft Server). While I may not be very active in terms of messages sent, I'm constantly working behind the stage to keep the server running.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you ever see me online, don't hesitate to say hello! If I don't respond I'm probably AFK or coding.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What I'm Proud Of:
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            On a fateful 2023 evening, a weary SunE sat down in front of his PC and logged on to Discord. Unfortunately, Jonathan was pulling a Jonathan and he painfully watched as every single channel vanished and all the users were banned. It was over for the POS... or was it?
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proud of my work as staff in POS, not just for the quick events but for everything: from rebuilding the Discord server to integrating useful bots; most of the things one can see in POS was created or edited by me in the past for a greater outcome in the future. Today I not only work with my fellow staff members to help out with tickets, requests, Minecraft servers, and challenges, but strive to keep building upon this very server that was fallen a year ago.
        </p>
