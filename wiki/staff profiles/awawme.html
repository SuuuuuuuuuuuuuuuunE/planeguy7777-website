            About Me
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I'm a kind person who enjoys nerding with my friends about various scientifc topics, reading thick fantasy novels, doing different kinds of math, and... yeah, I'm very nerdy.

            What I'm Proud of
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I'm friends with <a href="planeguy7777.html">planeguy</a> (I know him in real life) so when he invited me, I just joined.Eventually, JA apps rolled by, and I'm happy to say I got in on the second batch I applied for. Then I became SA, and eventually became SM. I've switched between SM and CM a couple times, and am currently EM. I am the one who started nicknaming planeguy - and the first one I gave him was planetgreen8888. Eventually, the entire server joined in and now multiple staff have weird nicknames including "rocky" for humunukudahlia, "evan" and "the toad" for totalirus, and "planetblue555", "henry", and many, many more for planeguy. I am also a highly accomplished countryball sniper, and along with totalirus, most of the ones that spawn are usually caught instead of despawning. I once was an acclaimed tour guide for PSB HQ, until it closed down. I have helped out with raids, behind-the-scenes staff stuff, and helping my fellow staff annoy planeguy.
