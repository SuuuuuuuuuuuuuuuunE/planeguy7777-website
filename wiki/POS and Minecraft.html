            The Planeguy7777 Minecraft Server was the first attempt at a Discord to Minecraft integration.
            First created by Planeguy, it (planeguy7777.aternos.me) was meant as a survival multiplayer server on Aternos.
            Shortly after, staff including SunE, cLAsp, and DavidPlayzYT were invited to build starting structures for incoming members.
            These include the:

            <li> Spawn Rules Board, Shops, and Fountain </li>

            The server officially opened around the 22nd of August, 2024, met with a fast downfall a few months later.
            Managers speculated it was due to the short period of advertising and too strict moderation, as members were only allowed online when a manager was moderating live.

            The Planeguy7777 Official Minecraft Server, or POMS, is the current standing revised reintroduction of the Minecraft server concept.
            With the address planeguy7777official.aternos.me, it was officially opened around November 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this reiteration, server rules were simplified and restrictions were released in order to ensure member convenience and server continuity.
            Every member with an Aternos account was able to start the server on demand, and PVP was allowed in moderation.
            No additional creations were built before the server opening.

            Though activity is less than the first opening of the server, it is still open to all POS members to play on.

            Griefings
        </h4>
        <p>
            POMS suffered a few griefings in its lifetime, many from the same user.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sign Changing: In November 2024, an unknown user griefed random signs in the world by changing their text inappropriately.
            </li>
            <li>
                World Destruction: In December 2024, the presumed unknown user logged on with their three Minecraft accounts by common the name "fog" while admins were offline.
                The user caused widespread damage by breaking countless blocks, stealing blocks, placing lava, lighting fires, changing more signs, and killing mobs.
                The verification system was only established after, along with integrated Aternos backups.
                Thus, cleanup was manual.
            </li>
            <li>
                Base Crater: A newly joined user created a hole in Sv. Buffer's base and placed buckets of lava stolen from the skybase, while claiming a creeper was responsible.
                This was reverted using a backup.
            </li>

            The last created Minecraft server got its name from a poll in April of 2025.
            Goldenvein is a creative mode building server where the single intent is to build a detailed city at a realistic level.
            Detailed rules are posted on POS, however essentially participants create houses, apartments, recreational centres, and much more from chosen plots of land on the map.

        <p>
            Being unmanaged by Planeguy himself, the server aims to be a Discord server-wide project with contributions from multiple people.
            The goal is to create a detailed world that can be used for multiple purposes.
            A PVP knockout, hide and seek, and puzzle maps have all been taken into consideration while planning the city.
