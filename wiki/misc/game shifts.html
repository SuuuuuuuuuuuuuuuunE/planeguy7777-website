            <b>Game Shifts</b> are activities hosted in POS. It is hosted exclusively by staff members, with the exception being member-hosted shifts, and can be joined freely by normal members through signing up. Although most game shifts are hosted by <a href="../staff profiles/planeguy7777.html">planeguy7777</a>, the <a href="../staff ranks/ea.html">EAs</a> and the <a href="../staff ranks/em.html">EM</a> get a quota of at least 3 shifts every month. The hosts will decide which games to play.

            Shifts
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            There are 2 types of shifts: <b>flash shifts</b> and <b>scheduled shifts</b>. Flash shifts are usually scheduled to start shortly after the announcement, usually 20 minutes to a few hours, while scheduled shifts are usually announced a few hours to days in advance. Flash shifts are often shorter than scheduled ones.

            Games

        <p>
            A wide variation of games have been featured during Game Shifts. Some popular games include Gartic Phone, Discord voice call games and also some Roblox games such as SCR, BR and Croydon. Those are only some popular ones, so the possibilities of what games to play are endless.

            Hosts and Co-Hosts
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Hosts and co-hosts are slightly different. Although they share the role of being in charge of the shifts, co-hosts are not always necessary. Hosts are the staff who will be managing the majority of the shift and post the shift announcement. Co-hosts are other staff who might sign up and join in after the shift is announced. Hosts may choose how many cohosts, if any, they want in their shift.
        </p>

            Shift Ending
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Shifts end differently, in 3 possible ways.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The shifts are concluded as scheduled, and are finished after played for the planned time. Shift count will be increased.
            </li>
            <li>
                The shifts are concluded early. This may be due to of all members leaving midway through the shift, or because of an insufficient number of players to start the shift. This is quite common as of writing this. Shift count will be increased.
            </li>
            <li>
                The shifts get cancelled. This is usually caused by the host being unavailable to host the shift. Shift count will not increase.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Early on in the shift programme, instead of concluding shifts early due to insufficient players, the shifts would be cancelled.

            <li>
                There is a shift calendar, where shifts are marked.

                Community Manager <a href="../staff profiles/gabyt31">gabyt31</a> is usually the one managing shift quotas. Thanks Gaby!
            </li>
            <li>
                Many staff despise shift quotas. Despite that, shifts are still fun to host and participate in.
