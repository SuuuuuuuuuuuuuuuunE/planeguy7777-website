            The <b>POS bots</b> were made by <a href="../staff profiles/planeguy7777.html">planeguy7777</a> in late 2023 and early 2024. They were originally envisioned to be bots to help the community of POS. Many plans were abandoned early on due to planeguy7777 lacking the abilities to code the bots using discord.py. Many have since been renamed and put to use for other tasks.

            The first one created is the only one in regular use and that was <b>Planeguy Server Bot</b>, or <b>PSB</b> for short. It originally was made to be like SCR Assistance, a bot where you could make tickets/cases through and staff members would contact you with your questions and such. That works alright, and PSB went through many updates at that stage. Minor changes consisted of formatting and ticket/case modifications mostly.
        </p>
        <h4>
            PSB HQ
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>PSB Headquarters (PSB HQ)</b> was created for staff members to join one of two departments - <b>PD (Police Department)</b> and <b>ST (Service Team)</b>. PD was for handling reports from members against other staff members, and ST was for handling questions and suggestions for POS That was a separate server, which has since been abandoned and preserved as of writing this. In PSB HQ, the tickets/cases that were made through PSB would arrive in a specific channel, depending on the type of the ticket/case. PSB-PD later became what is now the <a href="../departments/security department.html">Security Department</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Flaws
        </h4>
        <p>
            There were flaws with PSB. First, it was barely online and therefore not everyone could use it. Second, the formatting for commands looked somewhat like report.userid.reason, which made it hard to complete sentences because periods were used to separate parts of the command, and was also very confusing to people who did not have that much experience with PSB in the first place. PSB was not the best for POS though as it made communication and the overall member experience further worse than a regular tickets bot would. Therefore, PSB was shut down, along with its headquarters.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Current Use
        </h4>
        <p>
            PSB nowadays has use like SCR Admin. It send messages for strikes, timeouts, and more, but also sends welcome messages and moderates channels where no chatting is allowed. It is online 24/7, except for times when it has disruptions to the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            PSB has multiple projects in testing and in plans as of the time of writing this. One such plan is making it control slowmode in the general channel, based on the rate of messages sent per minute. Testing is sometimes visible, with the code being run on <a href="#5">PSBSB</a>, another bot of POS.
        </p>

        <h3 id="2">
            HQTB
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>
            Relation to PSB HQ
        </h4>
        <p>
            After <b>PSB HQ</b> was fairly stable in terms of infrastructure, tours were opened up to the public, in a similar form as shifts, which were a lot more uncommon at the time. The principle was simple - allow people to look around PSB HQ on a virtual guided tour with prompts through text sent by the host/cohost(s).
        </p>
        <p>
            Tours would usually end up empty due to the extremely low member count at the time of tours in POS and also because of the lack of interest. After all, who would want to visit another server made for a bot they did not know how to use? Tours still continued, with tour guides being hired and having monthly quotas.
        </p>
        <h4>
            The Nuke on PSB HQ
        </h4>
        <p>
            After the nuke on October 25, 2023, severe reconsiderations of the tour system were brought into place. Fun fact, "ALL MY TOURS ARE CANCELLED WTH" was the first message sent in the new general channel after the nuke. It was sent by planeguy7777 and showed great concern in the tour system, which had just been deleted in the tragic event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not many records show after that, but tours ended shortly before the closure of PSB HQ. The current tours of PSB HQ happen semiannually (twice a year), or sometimes three times a year. These PSB HQ tours give visitors access to the channels that were once used for tickets and open around <a href="#1">PSB</a>'s birthday which is September 21, and other times when it feels right.
        </p>
        <h4>
            HQTB's Tours
        </h4>
        <p>
            This part of the article is about HQTB, but nothing has been mentioned about it, that is until now. The above was to add more information about the tours of PSB HQ. HQTB stands for <b>Headquarters Tour Bot</b>, and it handled the posting of tour messages. Like the early versions of PSB, it got many updates for formatting and ticket/case numbers. But what tickets/cases? HQTB had a feature later on in its life to request for compensation if a tour was cancelled or delayed heavily. This opened up a new department in PSB HQ, called HQTB-ST, with ST standing for Service Team.
        </p>
        <p>
            HQTB-ST was later renamed to TS for tour services, and not many people were actually part of this department, considering that there were little to no tickets/cases ever made.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Later Days
        </h4>
        <p>
            HQTB also later on in its life provided tours for <a href="#3">PSRB</a> HQ (in the PSB HQ server) and its own HQ (HQTB HQ). Currently, HQTB is nowhere to be found and even planeguy7777 does not know exactly which bot it is now. It has likely been rebranded and repurposed, and is likely duckduckduck or chickenchickenchicken, but there is no sure way of telling which was who.
        </p>
        <p>
            HQTB never had its own profile picture, and instead used the center of a abstract piece of art that was made in 2 minutes by planeguy7777, not specifically made for the bot.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Planeguy Server Role Bot</b>, or <b>PSRB</b> for short, was a bot made to have one very simple purpose - reaction roles. It never got that purpose and instead got repurposed into a ticket/case system just like PSB to request and remove roles, more specifically, ping roles.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, no members of the public ever used PSRB - only Grayson_GrayGrayson#3176 (one ticket/case), <a href="../staff profiles/sune.html">suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuune</a> (one ticket/case), <a href="../staff profiles/clasp.html">x_dam</a> (4 tickets/cases), and <a href="../staff profiles/humu.html">humunukufish</a> (5 tickets/cases). They were all staff and were just trying out a simple command planeguy7777 had directly messaged them in a request to test the new bot.
        </p>
        <p>
            PSRB never saw the light of day in terms of public usage in POS and probably never will for its original purpose. It just might be rebranded and reused for something else in the future, but only time will tell.

            <b>Planeguy Server Bot Status Bot (PSBSB)</b> is quite a tongue-twister when it comes to POS's bot names. To understand the original planned usage of this bot, one must go back in time to get background information.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Bot Statuses
        </h4>
        <p>
            In the early days of POS's Discord bots, bots would usually not be online for very long and would have an online/offline status. This was a massive reason why many of the bots failed to be of any use to POS, apart from the limited abilities in coding and the complexity of commands. Apart from all of that, there would sometimes be a bot status tracker sent out by planeguy7777 that would show the current online/offline status of each bot in POS, including SunBot, made by SunE, which was originally somewhat of a POS-based bot at the start. Planeguy7777 would edit that message with bot statuses a lot during the day and that would be very annoying, therefore a solution came up - why not just make a bot to do that?
        </p>
        <h4>
            Making the Bot
        </h4>
        <p>
            The bot was made on Discord and BotGhost was first looked at. BotGhost was simple to use (as planeguy7777 first thought in comparison to Python line coding) and could make bots be online 24/7, which was impossible to do at the time. The planned concept was very simple - use slash commands to tell PSBSB when a bot went online or offline so that it could edit its message.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Repurposing
        </h4>
        <p>
            This never happened and some of the commands still exist and can be sent (but not used) in POS. The bot had been abandoned essentially the same day it was created (not confirmed), but it had a different job it would be useful for - and that would be testing for PSB.
        </p>

            <b>Planeguy Event Bot (PEB)</b> was a concept of having a bot that could help out in out-of-POS events. These events would be in outside servers, made specifically for the events themselves. PEB never came into existence, but something else did.
        </p>
        <h4>
            PEPB
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>Planeguy Event Participation Bot</b>, or <b>PEPB</b> for short, is a modern version of this, but it lies untouched as it has not been used for an event yet. The PEB Logo has been used for two events in the entirety of POS Event history. One of them was the POS Cheese Event 2023/I, and the other event was the first annual holiday event, Annual Holiday Event 2023/I.
